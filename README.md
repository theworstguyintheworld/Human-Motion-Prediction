# LG-Net and LGT-Net
We address the challenge of 3D human motion prediction from motion capture data.
We propose two lightweight network structures for human motion prediction: LG-Net and LGT-Net, which focus on the individual movements of distinct human limbs and their inter-dependencies. 
The LG-Net comprises local and global networks, while the LGT-Net combines the proposed LG-Net structure with Long and Short Term Memory (LSTM) cells to exploit temporal information. In addition, this study is the first to consider the root joint to improve motion prediction performance.
